      "title": "Introduction to Mitochondrial Disease",
      "content": "Mitochondria are the primary producers of cellular ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). They are found in virtually all nucleated cells, and tissues with high metabolic demand — brain, muscle, heart, liver, kidney — are most vulnerable when OXPHOS is impaired. Mitochondrial diseases are clinically and genetically heterogeneous: they can present at any age, affect any organ, and arise from variants in either the mitochondrial genome or nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. The overall prevalence is approximately 1/5,000 — making them among the most common inborn errors of metabolism.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Mitochondrial disease can be caused by pathogenic variants in the ~37-gene mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) or in ~1,500 nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins",
        "The clinical hallmark is multi-system involvement in organs with high energy demand — 'think mitochondria' when a patient has neurological + muscular + cardiac + hepatic features",
        "Common neurological presentations: Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalopathy), MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes), MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers), Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)",
        "Elevated plasma/CSF lactate with elevated lactate:pyruvate ratio is the classic metabolic signature, but a normal lactate does NOT exclude mitochondrial disease",

      "content": "The human mitochondrial genome is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule of 16,569 bp, encoding 13 OXPHOS subunit proteins, 22 transfer RNAs, and 2 ribosomal RNAs. The vast majority of mitochondrial proteins (~99%) are encoded by nuclear DNA and imported into mitochondria. Disease can arise from pathogenic variants in either genome, and nuclear gene variants are more common overall.",

        "Heteroplasmy: the coexistence of mutant and wild-type mtDNA molecules within the same cell or tissue; contrasts with homoplasmy (all copies identical)",
        "Threshold effect: clinical disease only manifests when mutant mtDNA exceeds a tissue-specific threshold (~60–90% depending on tissue and variant); below threshold, residual wild-type mtDNA maintains sufficient OXPHOS capacity",
        "Bottleneck effect: during oogenesis, the number of mtDNA molecules is dramatically reduced and then re-amplified; this random sampling creates large heteroplasmy shifts between mother and offspring — a mother with 40% heteroplasmy may have children ranging from 5% to 95%",
        "Tissue heterogeneity: heteroplasmy can vary substantially between tissues (blood, urine, muscle, hair follicles); blood is convenient but may not reflect heteroplasmy in affected tissues; muscle biopsy or urine often provides higher sensitivity",

      "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents with recurrent stroke-like episodes with posterior-predominant MRI changes that do not respect vascular territories, lactic acidosis, sensorineural hearing loss, and maternal relatives with diabetes and deafness. The most likely diagnosis and causative variant are:",
      "options": [
        "MERRF syndrome caused by m.8344A>G in MT-TK",
        "MELAS syndrome most commonly caused by m.3243A>G in MT-TL1",

        "Kearns-Sayre syndrome caused by a large mtDNA deletion"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "This is a classic MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, Stroke-like Episodes) presentation. The posterior-predominant MRI lesions not respecting vascular territories, lactic acidosis, maternal diabetes + deafness, and sensorineural hearing loss are hallmarks. The m.3243A>G variant in MT-TL1 (encoding mitochondrial tRNA-Leu) accounts for ~80% of MELAS cases. MERRF causes myoclonus + epilepsy (not stroke-like episodes). KSS causes PEO + pigmentary retinopathy. Leigh syndrome is primarily a pediatric disease."

      "question": "A woman with 40% m.3243A>G heteroplasmy in blood wants to know the risk that her children will have mitochondrial disease. Which statement BEST describes the counseling?",
      "options": [
        "50% of her children will inherit the variant and have 40% heteroplasmy, just like her",
        "Because mtDNA is maternal, all children will inherit the variant; their specific heteroplasmy levels are unpredictable due to the mitochondrial bottleneck",
        "None of her children will be affected because 40% heteroplasmy is below the threshold for MELAS",
        "Male children cannot be affected because mtDNA disease is X-linked"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "All children of a woman with a heteroplasmic mtDNA variant will inherit some copies of the variant (maternal inheritance). However, the mitochondrial bottleneck — a dramatic reduction and re-amplification of mtDNA during oogenesis — means that heteroplasmy levels in offspring can range from very low (<5%) to very high (>95%), regardless of the mother's heteroplasmy. A mother with 40% heteroplasmy may have a child with 2% (asymptomatic) or 90% (severely affected). This unpredictability makes counseling extremely challenging."

        "Subsarcolemmal proliferation of abnormal mitochondria, producing a ragged red appearance",
        "Glycogen accumulation in type II muscle fibers (Pompe disease)",
        "Fiber type grouping caused by reinnervation after motor neuron disease"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Ragged-red fibers on Gomori modified trichrome stain reflect the compensatory proliferation of dysfunctional mitochondria beneath the sarcolemma and between myofibrils. This proliferation is the muscle fiber's attempt to generate more ATP by producing more (albeit dysfunctional) mitochondria. On COX/SDH combined staining, these fibers typically appear blue (SDH-positive, COX-negative in Complex IV disorders) or hyper-reactive. Ragged-red fibers are a hallmark of mitochondrial myopathy, seen in MELAS, MERRF, KSS, and other mtDNA disorders."

        "POLG — polymerase gamma variants cause valproate-induced hepatotoxicity and are an absolute contraindication",
        "MT-TL1 — MELAS patients are uniquely susceptible due to impaired liver OXPHOS",
        "PDHA1 — pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency exacerbates valproate metabolism"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Valproate-induced hepatotoxicity (Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome) is most strongly associated with biallelic pathogenic variants in POLG (polymerase gamma), the gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA replication enzyme. Valproate inhibits POLG and mitochondrial beta-oxidation, precipitating acute hepatic failure in POLG-deficient patients. Before prescribing valproate for any epileptic encephalopathy, POLG testing should be strongly considered. POLG variants are an absolute contraindication to valproate. This is one of the most clinically critical pharmacogenomic interactions in neurogenetics."

        "Leber hereditary optic neuropathy — optic nerve T2 signal with relative brain sparing"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Bilateral symmetric T2 hyperintensity involving the basal ganglia (especially putamen), thalami, and brainstem (periaqueductal gray, dorsal medulla) is the defining MRI pattern of Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalopathy). Combined with elevated lactate in a child, this MRI is diagnostic of Leigh syndrome pending molecular confirmation. The lesions reflect energy failure in high-metabolic-demand brain regions. Leigh syndrome is caused by variants in >75 genes and is the most common mitochondrial disease phenotype in childhood."
