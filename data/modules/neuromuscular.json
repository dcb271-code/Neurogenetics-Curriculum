The clinical pattern — proximal vs. distal weakness, presence of sensory involvement, reflexes, cardiac involvement, family history — guides localization and genetic differential. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) are essential for localization before genetic testing.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Proximal > distal weakness without sensory loss: suggests myopathy or anterior horn disease (SMA); elevated CK points to myopathy",
        "Distal > proximal weakness with sensory loss: peripheral neuropathy (CMT); decreased/absent reflexes; nerve conduction shows demyelinating or axonal pattern",
        "NMJ disorder (myasthenia gravis, congenital myasthenic syndrome): fatigable weakness, ptosis, diplopia; EMG shows decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation",

      "content": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are allelic X-linked recessive disorders caused by variants in the DMD gene (Xp21.2), encoding dystrophin — the largest gene in the human genome. Dystrophin links the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix via the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). Loss of dystrophin leads to membrane fragility, calcium influx, oxidative stress, and progressive muscle fiber necrosis and replacement by fat and connective tissue.",

It is caused by loss of survival motor neuron protein (SMN) due to homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene on 5q13. SMN is essential for snRNP biogenesis and pre-mRNA splicing in motor neurons. The SMN2 gene, a nearly identical paralog on the same chromosome, produces only ~10–15% full-length SMN due to alternative splicing at exon 7 — the copy number of SMN2 is the major modifier of phenotype severity.",

      "options": [
        "Becker muscular dystrophy — the deletion is in-frame and produces truncated dystrophin",
        "Duchenne muscular dystrophy — the deletion is out-of-frame and abolishes dystrophin production",

      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The reading-frame rule predicts that deletions disrupting the translational reading frame cause DMD (no functional dystrophin), while in-frame deletions cause BMD (truncated but partially functional dystrophin). Deletion of exons 48–50 shifts the reading frame, predicting a DMD phenotype. This patient's presentation (Gowers sign, pseudohypertrophy, CK 25,000) is entirely consistent. Notably, exon 51 skipping therapy would convert this to an in-frame deletion (removing exon 51 makes the exon 47–52 junction in-frame), potentially converting to BMD-like disease."

      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Multiple clinical trials demonstrate that presymptomatic treatment of SMA — initiated before motor neuron loss occurs — yields dramatically better outcomes than post-symptomatic treatment. Children treated presymptomatically with onasemnogene abeparvovec or nusinersen often achieve nearly normal motor milestones. This is the primary rationale for newborn screening for SMA. All children with biallelic SMN1 deletion, regardless of SMN2 copy number, should be offered treatment promptly."

      "explanation": "The combination of AD inheritance, childhood onset, distal weakness with high arches, and uniformly slow MCVs (22 m/s — well below the 38 m/s threshold for demyelinating CMT) is classic for CMT1A. PMP22 duplication on chromosome 17p12 is the most common CMT mutation, accounting for ~40% of all CMT. It is detected by MLPA or aCGH. CMT2A (MFN2) has axonal pattern with normal or near-normal velocity and reduced amplitude."

      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The most serious complication of Emery-Dreifuss MD (especially LMNA-related) is cardiac involvement — progressive conduction disease, complete heart block, and dilated cardiomyopathy — which can cause sudden death even when muscular weakness is mild. Annual cardiac surveillance with ECG, Holter monitoring, and echocardiography is essential. Pacemaker implantation is often required for conduction disease, and ICD for those with reduced ejection fraction. This cardiac risk applies even to female carriers of LMNA variants."

        "Trinucleotide repeat expansion encoding a toxic polyglutamine protein"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In FSHD1, contraction of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats on 4q35 (normally 11–100 units; disease: 1–10 units) leads to chromatin relaxation and epigenetic derepression of the DUX4 retrogene embedded within each unit. Critically, this only causes disease when the contracted array is on a 4qA haplotype bearing a polyadenylation signal that stabilizes DUX4 mRNA. DUX4 is a developmental transcription factor toxic to muscle cells. FSHD2 achieves the same epigenetic state via SMCHD1 haploinsufficiency (hypomethylation of the D4Z4 region) without array contraction."
