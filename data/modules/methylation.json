      "title": "Molecular Basis of DNA Methylation",
      "content": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification involving the covalent addition of a methyl group to the 5-carbon position of cytosine residues, primarily at CpG dinucleotides — regions where cytosine is followed by guanine in the 5'→3' direction. CpG islands, clusters of CpGs typically located at gene promoters, are normally unmethylated in active genes; methylation of promoter CpGs silences transcription by blocking transcription factor binding and recruiting repressive chromatin-remodeling complexes. DNA methylation patterns are established by de novo methyltransferases (DNMT3A, DNMT3B) during early development and maintained through cell division by DNMT1.",

      "title": "Genomic Imprinting and Its Disorders",
      "content": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon in which gene expression depends on which parent contributed the allele — certain genes are expressed exclusively from the maternally inherited chromosome, others only from the paternal chromosome. Imprinting is established by imprinting control regions (ICRs) — differentially methylated regions set during gametogenesis and maintained throughout development. Humans have approximately 100 imprinted genes, many clustered on specific chromosomes (15q11-13, 11p15.5, 7q32, 20q13). Disruption of imprinting causes a distinct class of disorders with parent-of-origin inheritance patterns that appear to violate Mendelian rules.",

    {
      "question": "A 3-year-old boy has hyperphagia, obesity, hypotonia since infancy, and mild intellectual disability. DNA methylation analysis at SNRPN shows only the methylated (maternal) band — the paternal (unmethylated) band is absent. Which mechanism is LEAST likely to explain this result?",
      "options": [
        "Paternal deletion of 15q11-13",
        "Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15",
        "Imprinting center defect causing abnormal methylation of the paternal allele",
        "Point variant in the UBE3A gene"
      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Absence of the paternal (unmethylated) band at SNRPN indicates loss of paternal 15q11-13 expression — consistent with Prader-Willi syndrome caused by paternal deletion, maternal UPD15, or an imprinting center defect. A UBE3A point variant would cause Angelman syndrome (loss of maternal expression), not PWS — and would show normal SNRPN methylation. UBE3A variants account for ~10% of AS cases but are not detected by the SNRPN methylation test."

      "question": "A child has severe intellectual disability, absent speech, frequent smiling/laughing, and drug-resistant epilepsy. EEG shows high-amplitude delta activity. Methylation analysis at 15q11-13 is normal. Which test should be performed next to complete the Angelman syndrome workup?",
      "options": [

        "Chromosomal microarray to detect a small deletion",

        "Repeat methylation testing on a different tissue"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The clinical presentation is classic for Angelman syndrome. Normal methylation testing excludes deletion of the maternal 15q11-13 region, maternal UPD15, and most imprinting center defects (~80% of AS cases). The remaining causes are UBE3A point variants (~10%) and unknown (~15%). The next step is sequencing of UBE3A (and deletion/duplication analysis), which would identify pathogenic coding variants not detectable by methylation assays."

      "question": "Episignature analysis using a genome-wide methylation array can be used diagnostically because:",
      "options": [
        "It directly sequences the DNA to find pathogenic variants",
        "Each Mendelian disorder caused by a chromatin regulator produces a characteristic genome-wide methylation pattern",
        "It measures gene expression levels across all tissues simultaneously",
        "It detects large chromosomal imbalances more accurately than SNP microarray"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Episignature analysis leverages the fact that proteins involved in chromatin regulation (writers, readers, erasers of epigenetic marks) establish and maintain specific methylation patterns across the genome. When these proteins are dysfunctional, a reproducible and disorder-specific genome-wide methylation profile (episignature) is produced. Over 50 disorders have defined episignatures, enabling classification of variants of uncertain significance and diagnosis of clinically ambiguous presentations."

    {
      "question": "The therapeutic strategy of using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting UBE3A-ATS for Angelman syndrome works because:",
      "options": [
        "ASOs deliver a functional copy of UBE3A protein directly to neurons",
        "ASOs methylate and silence the paternal 15q11-13 region, preventing PWS",
        "ASOs block UBE3A-ATS, a non-coding RNA that normally silences the paternal UBE3A allele in neurons, allowing its expression",
        "ASOs correct the UBE3A splicing defect caused by the maternal deletion"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "In neurons specifically, the paternal UBE3A allele is silenced by a long non-coding RNA called UBE3A-ATS (antisense transcript). In Angelman syndrome, the maternal UBE3A allele is lost (deleted, UPD, etc.), but the paternal allele is present — just silenced by UBE3A-ATS. ASOs targeting and degrading UBE3A-ATS unsilence the paternal copy, restoring UBE3A protein. This is a uniquely elegant neurogenetic approach that exploits the neuron-specific nature of UBE3A imprinting."

        "Mitochondrial DNA sequencing, as Kabuki has a maternal inheritance pattern",
        "Genome-wide methylation array for episignature analysis — KMT2D/KDM6A dysfunction produces a characteristic methylation fingerprint",
        "Chromosomal microarray to detect a deletion at the KMT2D locus on 12q13",
        "Frataxin protein level, as Kabuki syndrome is associated with repeat expansion"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "KMT2D (a histone methyltransferase) and KDM6A (a histone demethylase) are chromatin regulators that establish characteristic genome-wide methylation episignatures when dysfunctional. Genome-wide methylation array can detect the Kabuki episignature even in the absence of a detectable sequence variant — helping to classify VUS or identify a diagnosis when sequencing is non-diagnostic. This is one of the most clinically useful applications of episignature analysis in dysmorphology."
