      "title": "What Is Epigenetics?",
      "content": "Epigenetics refers to heritable changes in gene expression and chromatin structure that occur without alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms serve as the molecular interface between an organism's static genome and a dynamic environment, allowing context-dependent gene regulation across development, aging, and in response to experience.",

      "content": "DNA methylation involves the covalent addition of a methyl group (−CH₃) to the 5-carbon of cytosine residues, predominantly at CpG dinucleotides. This modification is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and is the most extensively characterized epigenetic mark in mammals.",

      "content": "Genomic DNA is packaged by wrapping ~147 base pairs around a histone octamer (H2A, H2B, H3, H4) to form the nucleosome — the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin. The unstructured N-terminal tails of histones are subject to more than 100 known post-translational modifications that together form a combinatorial 'histone code' governing gene expression.",

    {
      "question": "Which statement best defines an epigenetic change?",

        "A permanent alteration in the DNA nucleotide sequence passed to offspring",
        "A heritable change in gene expression or chromatin structure without altering the DNA sequence",
        "A change in mRNA stability caused by RNA-binding proteins",
        "A somatic point mutation affecting a single cell"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Epigenetic changes are heritable modifications to gene expression or chromatin organization that do not change the underlying DNA sequence. They include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling — all reversible and context-dependent."

      "answer": 2,

      "question": "Rett Syndrome is caused by MECP2 loss-of-function mutations. What is the normal molecular function of MECP2?",
      "options": [
        "It methylates cytosine residues at CpG sites as a de novo DNA methyltransferase",
        "It binds methylated CpG dinucleotides and recruits co-repressor complexes to silence genes",
        "It demethylates histone H3K27me3 marks as a histone demethylase",
        "It slides nucleosomes along DNA by hydrolyzing ATP"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "MECP2 is a methyl-CpG binding protein — a 'reader' of DNA methylation. It binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides and recruits co-repressor complexes (including Sin3A and HDACs) to silence target genes. Loss of MECP2 in Rett syndrome leads to widespread transcriptional dysregulation throughout the brain."

        "Deletion of the FMR1 gene through large-scale chromosomal rearrangement"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "When the CGG repeat in the FMR1 5' UTR expands beyond ~200 copies (full mutation), it triggers dense DNA methylation of the FMR1 promoter, completely silencing the gene. Loss of FMRP — an mRNA-binding protein critical for synaptic plasticity — is the molecular basis of Fragile X Syndrome."
