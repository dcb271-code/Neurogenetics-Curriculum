      "content": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is clinically defined as a group of permanent disorders of movement and posture caused by non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain. Historically, CP was considered synonymous with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. However, large epidemiological and genomic studies now demonstrate that genetic causes — including chromosomal abnormalities, pathogenic copy number variants, and single-gene disorders — account for approximately 20–30% of CP cases, and potentially more in cases without a clear perinatal etiology.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Modern definition: CP is a clinical syndrome (motor impairment + non-progressive brain abnormality) — not a specific diagnosis; etiology must be sought",
        "Genetic contribution: ~14–31% of 'idiopathic' CP cases have identifiable genetic cause by chromosomal microarray + exome sequencing; genetic cause more common in term births without perinatal risk factors",
        "CP mimics (treatable conditions misdiagnosed as CP): dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT-GCH1; see [[dystonia|Genetic Dystonias]] module), GLUT1 deficiency, AADC deficiency (DDC), glutaric aciduria type 1, biotinidase deficiency, arginase deficiency (ARG1) — critical to exclude before accepting CP label",
        "Brain imaging in CP: MRI normal in 15–30% — higher genetic yield in these cases; periventricular leukomalacia (preterm injury), cortical dysplasia (genetic), vascular patterns (coagulopathy, COL4A1) all provide diagnostic clues",
        "Clinical subtypes and genetic associations: spastic diplegia (periventricular leukomalacia most common — but also SPAST, PLP1 spastic paraplegia), dystonic CP (often treatable, DRD must be excluded), hemiplegic CP (focal cortical malformation, stroke, COL4A1)"

These include classic chromosomal aneuploidies, sub-microscopic deletions and duplications detected by microarray, and uniparental disomy. Recognition of a chromosomal etiology reframes the diagnosis, provides recurrence risk information, and may identify additional health surveillance needs.",

      "question": "A 4-year-old child born at term without perinatal complications has been labeled with 'spastic diplegic cerebral palsy.' MRI is reported as normal. She has diurnal fluctuation of her tone — worse in the evening, better in the morning. The most important next step is:",
      "options": [
        "Chromosomal microarray to identify a CNV causing spastic diplegia",
        "Brain MRI at 3T with volumetric sequences — the normal MRI was likely a technical artifact",
        "A therapeutic trial of levodopa/carbidopa to evaluate for dopa-responsive dystonia",
        "Exome sequencing — this is likely a de novo SPAST variant causing hereditary spastic paraplegia"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Diurnal fluctuation of tone — worse in the evening, dramatically improved in the morning — is the cardinal feature of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD, GCH1 deficiency). DRD is one of the most important treatable mimics of cerebral palsy and should be excluded in any child with 'dystonic CP' or fluctuating tone before accepting the CP label. Response to low-dose levodopa is dramatic and sustained. Missing this diagnosis is clinically consequential."

      "question": "A term-born child with moderate intellectual disability, absent speech, seizures, and a happy, social demeanor is initially labeled with CP. SNRPN methylation testing shows only the unmethylated (paternal) band present, with the methylated (maternal) band absent. This child most likely has:",

        "Down syndrome — trisomy 21 presenting as spastic CP"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Absent maternal (methylated) SNRPN band indicates Angelman syndrome — loss of the maternal 15q11-13 region, resulting in absent UBE3A expression (UBE3A is expressed only from the maternal allele in neurons). In SNRPN methylation testing, the methylated allele is maternal and the unmethylated allele is paternal. In Angelman syndrome (maternal deletion/UPD/IC defect), the maternal (methylated) band is absent, leaving only the paternal (unmethylated) band. Conversely, in Prader-Willi syndrome (paternal deletion), the paternal (unmethylated) band is absent, leaving only the maternal (methylated) band. Angelman syndrome frequently presents as CP: ataxic gait, absent/minimal speech, seizures, and intellectual disability. The characteristic happy, social affect and seizure pattern (with triphasic EEG delta activity) distinguish it."

      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The highest genetic diagnostic yield in CP investigations occurs in children with: term birth, absence of a clear perinatal event, normal or non-lesional MRI, and additional features beyond motor impairment (family history, epilepsy, intellectual disability, movement disorder, regression). In this group, exome sequencing (trio preferred) has a diagnostic yield of ~25–30%. Children with clear acquired causes (perinatal asphyxia, PVL, trauma) have much lower genetic yields."

        "Glutaric acid accumulation causing direct cortical neurotoxicity"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In glutaric aciduria type 1 (GCDH gene deficiency), the typical neurological injury is acute bilateral striatal (caudate and putamen) necrosis that occurs during a febrile illness in the first 5 years of life. This 'striatal crisis' results in a dyskinetic-dystonic movement disorder that can be mistaken for dyskinetic CP. MRI shows bilateral striatal lesions + frontotemporal atrophy + macrocephaly. GA1 is detected on newborn screening, and dietary lysine restriction prevents striatal crisis — making early diagnosis critical."

        "No increased risk — de novo variants cannot recur"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "A confirmed de novo pathogenic variant (present in the child but absent from both parents' blood DNA) has a very low recurrence risk — generally <1% for the next pregnancy, reflecting the low but non-zero risk of germline mosaicism in one parent. It is important to counsel families that recurrence is unlikely but not impossible, and that prenatal testing (CVS or amniocentesis) for the known variant is available. The risk to the proband's own future children (when applicable) is 50% for a fully penetrant autosomal dominant variant."
