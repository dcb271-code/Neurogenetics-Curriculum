      "title": "Categories and Mechanisms of Neurological Injury in IEM",
      "content": "Inborn errors of metabolism are single-gene disorders causing dysfunction of a metabolic enzyme, transporter, or cofactor, leading to toxic substrate accumulation, deficiency of an essential product, or both. Neurological injury arises through several mechanisms: direct neurotoxicity of accumulated substrates (e.g., ammonia in urea cycle disorders, phenylalanine in PKU), energy failure from substrate deficiency (e.g., glucose transporter defects, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency), toxic metabolite accumulation (e.g., organic acids), membrane dysfunction (e.g., lysosomal storage disorders), and white matter destruction (e.g., leukodystrophies).",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Intoxication IEM: toxic substrate accumulates and causes acute neurological decompensation — aminoacidopathies (MSUD), organic acidemias (MMA, PA, IVA), urea cycle disorders (OTC deficiency) — management is acute detoxification",
        "Energy deficiency IEM: failure to generate sufficient ATP for neural function — mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders, PDH deficiency, fatty acid oxidation defects — may present with Reye-like episodes",
        "Storage disorders (lysosomal, peroxisomal): progressive accumulation of complex molecules in cells — GM1/GM2 gangliosidoses, MPS, Fabry disease, Krabbe, MLD — often slowly progressive",
        "Small molecule deficiencies: deficient production of a critical neuromodulator — BH4 (dopamine, serotonin synthesis), pyridoxine (vitamin B6 — cofactor for GAD and other enzymes), glucose (GLUT1 deficiency)",
        "Metabolic decompensation triggers in IEM: intercurrent illness, fasting, high-protein meal, surgery — catabolism floods the blocked pathway; key concept for acute management"

      "content": "Newborn screening (NBS) by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of dried blood spots has revolutionized early identification of treatable IEM before symptom onset. The US Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) includes >35 core conditions and 26 secondary conditions. MS/MS screens for amino acids and acylcarnitines in a single analysis. Expanded NBS programs in some states include dozens more conditions. A positive NBS is a screening result — confirmatory testing is always required before treatment.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "PKU (PAH deficiency): most common aminoacidopathy detected by NBS; elevated phenylalanine on MS/MS; confirmatory plasma amino acids; treatment with phenylalanine-restricted diet + BH4 (sapropterin) for BH4-responsive variants; pegvaliase (enzyme) for adults",
        "MSUD (maple syrup urine disease): elevated leucine, isoleucine, valine + alloisoleucine (pathognomonic); neonatal encephalopathy with cerebral edema if untreated; branched-chain amino acid restriction; liver transplant corrects enzymatic defect",
        "Urea cycle disorders (OTC deficiency — X-linked, most common): hyperammonemia detected indirectly by elevated citrulline or argininosuccinate; OTC deficiency itself not detected by amino acid NBS — hyperammonemia screen triggered by clinical presentation",
        "Fatty acid oxidation disorders (MCAD, VLCAD, LCHAD): characteristic acylcarnitine profiles; MCAD most common (C8-acylcarnitine); LCHAD causes cardiomyopathy + retinopathy + neuropathy; avoid fasting",

The choice depends on the biochemical mechanism, organ involvement, and availability. Early treatment is critical — neurological damage in most IEM is partially or fully irreversible if accumulated before treatment.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Dietary restriction: mainstay for PKU (phenylalanine), MSUD (BCAA), homocystinuria (methionine), GA1 (lysine/tryptophan), galactosemia (galactose); requires specialized formulas; adherence challenging lifelong",
        "Cofactor supplementation: pyridoxine (PDE, B6-responsive homocystinuria, B6-responsive seizures), biotin (biotinidase deficiency, MCD), BH4/sapropterin (BH4-responsive PKU, DRD), riboflavin (MADD, complex I/II), thiamine (thiamine-responsive disorders)",

      "question": "A newborn presents at 5 days of life with poor feeding, alternating hypo- and hypertonia, and a sweet maple syrup odor to the urine. Which amino acid is most specifically elevated and pathognomonic for this condition?",
      "options": [
        "Phenylalanine",
        "Arginine",
        "Alloisoleucine",
        "Homocysteine"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by deficiency of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, leading to accumulation of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The presence of alloisoleucine — a stereoisomer of isoleucine formed by transamination — is pathognomonic for MSUD and is not found in other aminoacidopathies. Severe leucine neurotoxicity causes cerebral edema and encephalopathy if untreated."

      "question": "A 3-year-old child has a CSF glucose of 25 mg/dL with a simultaneous blood glucose of 80 mg/dL (CSF:blood ratio 0.31). She has drug-resistant epilepsy, ataxia, and episodic dystonia. The most appropriate treatment is:",
      "options": [
        "Intravenous glucose infusion as rescue therapy",
        "Pyridoxine 100 mg IV to treat pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy",
        "Ketogenic diet to provide ketones as an alternative brain fuel",
        "Levodopa/carbidopa for dopa-responsive dystonia"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "A CSF:blood glucose ratio <0.45 (normal >0.60) in the appropriate clinical context (drug-resistant epilepsy, movement disorder in a child) is diagnostic of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (SLC2A1 mutations). The brain cannot import sufficient glucose, causing energy failure. The ketogenic diet bypasses this defect by providing ketones (3-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate), which are transported into the brain via MCT1 and serve as an alternative fuel. The diet is highly effective and is the standard of care."

    {
      "question": "A neonate presents with severe myoclonic seizures on day 1 of life. Seizures are refractory to phenobarbital and levalbuterol. The most important immediate diagnostic intervention is:",
      "options": [
        "Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging to exclude HIE",
        "Intravenous pyridoxine (vitamin B6) 100 mg as a therapeutic trial",
        "Lumbar puncture for CSF glucose to evaluate for GLUT1 deficiency",
        "Plasma amino acids to evaluate for MSUD"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) should be given intravenously to any neonate with refractory seizures, as pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE, ALDH7A1/antiquitin deficiency) can cause refractory neonatal seizures that dramatically respond to pyridoxine. Missing this diagnosis results in ongoing seizures and developmental injury. The trial is safe (even if PDE is absent, IV pyridoxine at standard doses is not harmful to neonates) and should precede or accompany other workup."

    {
      "question": "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is available for several lysosomal storage disorders but has limited efficacy for CNS manifestations. The primary reason is:",
      "options": [
        "The recombinant enzymes are too large to cross the blood-brain barrier",
        "IV-administered enzyme is rapidly degraded by serum proteases before reaching the brain",
        "Lysosomal enzyme deficiency does not affect neurons — only glial cells",
        "ERT causes immune reactions that block CNS delivery"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The major limitation of ERT for neurological LSDs (e.g., MPS, Fabry, Pompe) is that recombinant proteins (~60–80 kDa) do not cross the blood-brain barrier. IV-administered enzyme reaches liver, spleen, and bone marrow effectively but cannot access CNS neuronal and glial cells. This is why intrathecal or intracerebroventricular administration is being explored for MPS, and why gene therapy (AAV delivery directly to brain parenchyma) is a critical focus for neurological LSDs."

      "question": "A 17-year-old boy presents with progressive vertical gaze palsy, cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, and cognitive decline over 3 years. He had unexplained neonatal jaundice. His sister has a similar presentation. Which diagnostic test is most specific for confirming the suspected diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper (Wilson disease)",
        "Filipin staining of cultured skin fibroblasts for free cholesterol (Niemann-Pick type C)",
        "Urine organic acids during metabolic crisis (organic acidemia)",
        "Frataxin protein level (Friedreich ataxia)"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is suggested by the combination of vertical supranuclear gaze palsy (a cardinal sign), progressive ataxia, cognitive decline, and the history of neonatal jaundice (common early feature). NPC1/NPC2 mutations impair cholesterol transport, causing accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and sphingolipids in lysosomes. The filipin staining assay of skin fibroblasts (which shows perinuclear free cholesterol accumulation) is the classic diagnostic test, though NPC1/NPC2 sequencing is increasingly the primary diagnostic approach."
