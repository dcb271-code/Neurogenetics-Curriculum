      "content": "Pharmacogenetics is the study of how genetic variation influences drug response — affecting absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME), and pharmacodynamic drug targets. Genetic variants in drug-metabolizing enzymes alter plasma drug concentrations, creating a spectrum from toxicity (impaired metabolism → drug accumulation) to therapeutic failure (ultra-rapid metabolism → subtherapeutic levels). The major clinical phenotypes are: poor metabolizer (PM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), normal/extensive metabolizer (NM/EM), and ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM).",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Phase I metabolism: CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5) — oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis; most critical for neurological drug metabolism",
        "Phase II metabolism: UGT enzymes (glucuronidation), TPMT (thiopurine methylation), NAT2 (acetylation) — less critical for most neurological drugs but important for valproate (UGT1A6/UGT2B7)",
        "Star (*) allele nomenclature: reference allele = *1 (normal function); loss-of-function alleles (e.g., CYP2C9*2, *3); gain-of-function alleles (CYP2D6*1xN gene duplication = ultra-rapid)",
        "Copy number variation: CYP2D6 gene can be deleted (PM), duplicated (IM/NM), or multiplied (UM with >2 functional copies); CYP2D6*1xN duplication causes UM phenotype",

      "content": "Four CYP450 enzymes are most important for neurological drugs: CYP2C9 (phenytoin, valproate, losartan), CYP2C19 (clopidogrel, clobazam, diazepam, omeprazole), CYP2D6 (tricyclics, opioids, atomoxetine, antipsychotics), and CYP3A4/5 (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, statins). Polymorphisms in these enzymes are common — CYP2D6 PM phenotype affects ~7–10% of Europeans; CYP2C19 PM affects ~2–5% of Europeans but up to 15–20% of Asians.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "CYP2C9 and phenytoin: poor metabolizers (CYP2C9*2/*3 homozygous) have dramatically reduced phenytoin clearance → toxicity at standard doses; CPIC recommends 25–50% dose reduction and monitoring in PMs; phenytoin has narrow therapeutic index",
        "CYP2C19 and clopidogrel: clopidogrel is a prodrug requiring CYP2C19 activation; PMs (CYP2C19*2/*3) cannot convert to active thienopyridine → increased stroke/MI risk; CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles common in Asians (~50% have at least one); alternative antiplatelet therapy (prasugrel, ticagrelor) for PMs",
        "CYP2C19 and clobazam: clobazam is metabolized to active N-desmethylclobazam by CYP2C19; PMs have 5-fold higher N-desmethylclobazam levels → increased sedation risk; dose reduction recommended",
        "CYP2D6 and tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline): PMs have very high plasma levels → cardiac arrhythmia, anticholinergic toxicity; UMs have subtherapeutic levels; CPIC recommends alternative antidepressants for PMs/UMs",
        "CYP3A4/5 and carbamazepine: CYP3A4/5 metabolizes carbamazepine; also induces its own metabolism (autoinduction); drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers are complex; CYP3A5*3 reduces activity but clinical impact of genotype is less than for CYP2D6/2C19"

      "content": "Pharmacogenetic testing is increasingly available as preemptive panels that genotype multiple clinically actionable variants before drug prescribing is needed. Implementation requires understanding how to interpret multi-gene reports, recognizing the limitations of current evidence, and integrating results with clinical context. Several health systems have implemented preemptive pharmacogenomics as part of precision medicine initiatives.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Preemptive vs. reactive testing: reactive testing (at the time of prescribing) requires fast turnaround (days to weeks) which may delay treatment; preemptive panel testing (at first clinical encounter) stores results in EHR for all future prescribing decisions — more cost-effective over time",
        "Test report interpretation: reports gene name, diplotype (e.g., CYP2D6*1/*4), predicted phenotype (PM/IM/NM/UM), and drug-specific recommendations; metabolizer phenotypes are substrate-specific (same gene, different recommendations per drug)",
        "Evidence tiers: CPIC grades recommendations as A (action required), B (consider modification), C (inform/optional) — not all variants require prescribing changes; distinguish strong associations from weak signals",

        "HLA-B*15:02 genotyping to assess risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome",
        "SCN1A sequencing to confirm sodium channel sensitivity",

      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "HLA-B*15:02 is strongly associated with carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis in Southeast Asian populations (Han Chinese, Thai, Malaysian). The FDA mandates HLA-B*15:02 testing before starting carbamazepine in patients of Asian ancestry due to the markedly elevated risk (~25-fold increase). The allele is rare in European-ancestry patients (<0.1%), so testing is not required for European populations."

      "options": [
        "Start carbamazepine — it is effective for generalized epilepsies including Dravet",
        "Start carbamazepine only if EEG shows focal discharge patterns",
        "Avoid carbamazepine — sodium channel-blocking AEDs may paradoxically worsen seizures in Dravet syndrome",

      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Dravet syndrome is caused by SCN1A haploinsufficiency (loss of Nav1.1 function). Sodium channel-blocking AEDs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine) further reduce sodium channel activity and can paradoxically worsen seizures in Dravet syndrome — potentially causing status epilepticus. This is a critical pharmacogenomic drug contraindication. Appropriate agents for Dravet syndrome include valproate, clobazam, stiripentol, fenfluramine, and cannabidiol."

      "question": "A patient is found to be a CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM). She is started on nortriptyline for chronic pain. The pharmacogenetic concern is:",
      "options": [
        "She is at high risk for nortriptyline toxicity due to drug accumulation",
        "She may have subtherapeutic nortriptyline levels due to rapid metabolism, leading to treatment failure",

      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs) metabolize CYP2D6 substrates much faster than normal, resulting in subtherapeutic plasma drug concentrations at standard doses. For nortriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant metabolized primarily by CYP2D6), UM status leads to insufficient drug exposure and treatment failure. CPIC recommends using an alternative antidepressant not metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., citalopram, escitalopram) for UMs to avoid unpredictable dosing."

        "UGT2B7 genotype to predict valproate glucuronidation"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "POLG (mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma) mutations cause Alpers syndrome and related POLG-spectrum disorders. In these patients, valproate causes fulminant hepatotoxicity (liver failure) and neurological deterioration, often fatal. Any child with developmental regression, suspected mitochondrial disease, or features of Alpers syndrome (refractory seizures, hepatic involvement, cortical neurodegeneration) must be evaluated for POLG mutations before valproate is considered. This is the most critical drug contraindication in pediatric neurology."

        "Pregnancy induces CYP2D6 activity, dramatically increasing lamotrigine metabolism",
        "Estrogen and progesterone are competitive inhibitors of lamotrigine at the sodium channel",
        "Pregnancy-related induction of UGT1A4 (a lamotrigine-glucuronidating enzyme) dramatically increases lamotrigine clearance, reducing serum levels",
        "Fetal tissue absorbs lamotrigine, reducing maternal serum concentration"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Lamotrigine is primarily metabolized by glucuronidation via UGT1A4. During pregnancy, rising estrogen levels induce UGT1A4 activity, dramatically increasing lamotrigine clearance. Lamotrigine levels can decrease by 40–60% during pregnancy, leading to breakthrough seizures despite a previously stable dose. Frequent serum lamotrigine level monitoring is essential during pregnancy, and doses may need to double or triple. This interaction is one of the most clinically important drug-gene-state interactions in women with epilepsy."
