      "content": "Epilepsy affects approximately 1–2% of the population, and genetic factors are implicated in up to 70% of all epilepsy. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2017 classification recognizes 'genetic' as one of the primary epilepsy etiologies — defined as epilepsy resulting directly from a known or presumed genetic cause. The genetic architecture ranges from rare, highly penetrant single-gene disorders (causing severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathies) to common polygenic forms of epilepsy influenced by many variants of small effect.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Genetic epilepsies are clinically classified by seizure type, age of onset, EEG pattern, and associated features (developmental delay, regression, focal neurological deficits)",
        "~30% of pediatric-onset epilepsies have an identifiable genetic cause; yield increases to ~50–60% for epileptic encephalopathies (see the [[diagnostic-yields|Diagnostic Yields]] module for testing yields across neurogenetic conditions)",
        "De novo variants account for the majority of severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathies (Ohtahara, West, Dravet syndromes) — sporadic occurrence does not exclude genetic etiology",
        "Genetic diagnosis has direct treatment implications: SCN1A (avoid sodium channel blockers), KCNQ2 (sodium channel blockers beneficial), ALDH7A1 (pyridoxine), GLUT1 (ketogenic diet), SLC6A1 (avoid vigabatrin).

The genetic differential for neonatal seizures is broad and includes ion channelopathies, cortical malformation genes, inborn errors of metabolism, and imprinting disorders. Identifying the genetic cause is urgent because several conditions respond to specific treatments.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "KCNQ2/KCNQ3: Most common cause of genetic neonatal seizures; KCNQ2 encephalopathy presents on day 1–3 with tonic seizures and burst-suppression EEG; responds to sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, phenytoin); phenobarbital (a GABA-A receptor potentiator) is also used; self-limited familial neonatal epilepsy (milder phenotype) also caused by KCNQ2/3",
        "SCN2A: Highly variable — early-onset (<3 months) SCN2A gain-of-function variants cause epileptic encephalopathy (responds to Na-channel blockers); late-onset SCN2A loss-of-function variants cause epilepsy/autism that does NOT respond to Na-channel blockers (which should be avoided in LOF cases)",

Antiquitin deficiency causes accumulation of alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (AASA) and its cyclic form piperideine-6-carboxylate (P6C), which inactivates pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) by forming a Knoevenagel condensation product. The resulting cerebral PLP deficiency causes seizures.",

The clinician must integrate variant classification, gene-phenotype fit, inheritance pattern, and functional data to determine whether a genetic finding explains the patient's epilepsy. Understanding common pitfalls prevents both under- and over-interpretation of genetic results.",

  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "A 3-day-old term infant presents with tonic seizures, burst-suppression on EEG, and no family history. Metabolic workup is negative. Exome sequencing returns a de novo heterozygous loss-of-function variant in KCNQ2. What is the most appropriate initial anticonvulsant choice?",
      "options": [
        "Levetiracetam — broad spectrum and safe in neonates",
        "Sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, phenytoin) — KCNQ2 loss-of-function encephalopathy responds preferentially to sodium channel blockade",
        "Pyridoxine — to rule out pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy before starting other therapy",
        "Vigabatrin — first-line for epileptic encephalopathy with burst suppression"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "KCNQ2 encodes the Kv7.2 voltage-gated potassium channel subunit. Loss-of-function (LoF) variants in KCNQ2 cause neonatal epileptic encephalopathy — reduced M-current (Kv7.2/Kv7.3) diminishes the normal brake on neuronal excitability, leading to seizures. Critically, sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin) are highly effective in KCNQ2 LoF encephalopathy and should be prioritized. This is a clear example of precision/genotype-guided therapy in genetic epilepsy."

      "question": "An infant with unexplained refractory neonatal seizures is found to have elevated urine alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (AASA). The most likely diagnosis and initial treatment are:",
      "options": [
        "Pyridoxal-5-phosphate oxidase deficiency (PNPO) — treat with pyridoxine 100 mg IV",
        "Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (ALDH7A1) — treat with pyridoxine supplementation",
        "GLUT1 deficiency — treat with ketogenic diet and check CSF glucose",
        "Nonketotic hyperglycinemia — treat with sodium benzoate"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Elevated urine AASA is the diagnostic biomarker for pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy caused by ALDH7A1 (antiquitin) deficiency. AASA accumulation leads to inactivation of pyridoxal-5-phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6), causing cerebral PLP deficiency and seizures. Treatment is lifelong pyridoxine supplementation. PNPO deficiency causes a similar phenotype but requires pyridoxal-5-phosphate (not pyridoxine), and AASA is not elevated in PNPO deficiency."

      "question": "A toddler is found to have a CSF glucose of 28 mg/dL with a simultaneous serum glucose of 82 mg/dL (CSF/serum ratio 0.34). This pattern suggests which diagnosis and treatment?",
      "options": [
        "Bacterial meningitis — start empirical antibiotics and dexamethasone immediately",
        "GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (SLC2A1) — initiate ketogenic diet to provide an alternative brain fuel",
        "Hypoglycorrhachia due to subarachnoid hemorrhage — perform CT head",
        "Nonketotic hyperglycinemia — restrict dietary protein intake"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "A CSF/serum glucose ratio <0.4 (normal ≥0.6) in the absence of CNS infection indicates hypoglycorrhachia due to impaired glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier — the hallmark of GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (SLC2A1 haploinsufficiency). The brain is deprived of its primary fuel. The ketogenic diet provides ketone bodies as an alternative brain fuel and is highly effective. GLUT1 deficiency presents with infantile-onset epilepsy, developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, and paroxysmal movement disorder."

      "question": "A genetic test returns a heterozygous SCN1A frameshift variant (PVS1 + PM2 + PP4 = Pathogenic) in a 7-month-old with febrile seizures. What medication class should be avoided?",
      "options": [
        "Benzodiazepines — contraindicated in Dravet syndrome",
        "Sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin) — worsen seizures in SCN1A haploinsufficiency",
        "Levetiracetam — increases sodium channel activity and worsens Dravet",
        "Valproate — hepatotoxicity risk is too high in SCN1A-positive patients"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "SCN1A encodes the Nav1.1 sodium channel subunit, preferentially expressed in GABAergic interneurons. Haploinsufficiency (loss of function) reduces inhibitory interneuron firing, causing the net hyperexcitability of Dravet syndrome. Sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine) further reduce Nav1.1 activity and are contraindicated — they can precipitate status epilepticus in Dravet syndrome. Valproate, benzodiazepines, and levetiracetam are commonly used and generally well-tolerated."

      "question": "In a child with refractory epilepsy and a previously non-diagnostic exome, when should exome reanalysis be performed?",
      "options": [
        "Only if the child's phenotype changes significantly",
        "After a negative repeat metabolic workup",
        "Every 1–3 years, since new gene-disease associations and variant classifications are published continuously",
        "Reanalysis is not indicated — if exome was non-diagnostic, proceed directly to genome sequencing"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Genomic knowledge expands rapidly: new gene-disease associations are established, novel variant evidence accumulates in ClinVar and literature, and VUS are reclassified regularly. Systematic reanalysis of previously non-diagnostic exomes yields new diagnoses in ~10–15% of cases at 1–3 year intervals. Reanalysis is recommended by ACMG guidelines and should be part of the management plan for unsolved epilepsy patients. Genome sequencing adds value but does not replace reanalysis of existing exome data, which may already contain the answer in a newly recognized gene."
