      "content": "At rest, neurons maintain a stable voltage difference across their plasma membrane — the resting membrane potential — of approximately −70 mV (inside negative).

      "title": "The Action Potential",
      "content": "An action potential (AP) is a rapid, all-or-none reversal of membrane potential that propagates along the axon without loss of amplitude. It is triggered when a depolarizing stimulus brings the membrane to threshold (~−55 mV) and involves the sequential activation of voltage-gated ion channels.",

        "Depolarization: voltage-gated Na⁺ channels open → Na⁺ rushes in → membrane potential surges to ~+40 mV",
        "Repolarization: Na⁺ channels inactivate; delayed voltage-gated K⁺ channels open → K⁺ flows out → potential falls",
        "Hyperpolarization (undershoot): K⁺ channels close slowly, driving the membrane briefly below resting potential",

  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "Which ion movement is primarily responsible for establishing the resting membrane potential of ~−70 mV?",
      "options": [
        "Na⁺ leaking into the cell through voltage-gated channels",
        "Ca²⁺ leaking into the cell through leak channels",
        "K⁺ leaking out of the cell through K⁺ leak channels",
        "Cl⁻ leaking into the cell through GABA-A receptors"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "At rest, the neuronal membrane is most permeable to K⁺ via K⁺ leak channels. Since K⁺ is highly concentrated inside the cell, it diffuses outward down its concentration gradient, making the interior electrically negative (approximately −70 mV)."
    },
    {
      "question": "During the depolarization phase of an action potential, which ion enters the cell and through which channel type?",
      "options": [
        "K⁺ through voltage-gated K⁺ channels",
        "Na⁺ through voltage-gated Na⁺ channels",
        "Ca²⁺ through ligand-gated Ca²⁺ channels",
        "Cl⁻ through voltage-gated Cl⁻ channels"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "When the membrane reaches threshold, voltage-gated Na⁺ channels open rapidly. Na⁺ rushes into the cell down its steep electrochemical gradient, causing a rapid depolarization to approximately +40 mV."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of the myelin sheath around axons?",
      "options": [
        "To synthesize and store neurotransmitters",
        "To provide direct metabolic energy (ATP) to the axon",
        "To increase the speed of action potential propagation via saltatory conduction",
        "To prevent voltage-gated Na⁺ channels from opening"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Myelin acts as electrical insulation, forcing action potentials to 'jump' between exposed nodes of Ranvier — a process called saltatory conduction. This dramatically increases conduction velocity while reducing metabolic cost."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which ion channel opening is the critical trigger for neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal?",
      "options": [
        "Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels",
        "Voltage-gated K⁺ channels",
        "Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels",
        "Ligand-gated AMPA receptors"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "When an action potential depolarizes the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open. The resulting Ca²⁺ influx is the essential trigger for SNARE-protein-mediated fusion of synaptic vesicles and exocytosis of neurotransmitter."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does activation of GABA-A receptors inhibit neuronal firing?",
      "options": [
        "By blocking voltage-gated Na⁺ channels directly",
        "By opening Cl⁻ channels, causing Cl⁻ influx that hyperpolarizes the membrane",
        "By activating Gi proteins that reduce intracellular cAMP levels",
        "By triggering K⁺ efflux through NMDA receptors"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "GABA-A receptors are ionotropic Cl⁻ channels. When GABA binds, Cl⁻ flows into the neuron (because its equilibrium potential is typically more negative than the resting potential), hyperpolarizing the membrane and reducing the probability of reaching action potential threshold."
