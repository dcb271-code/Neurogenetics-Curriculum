      "content": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are structural genomic variants in which a segment of DNA is present at a copy number that differs from the normal diploid state. CNVs range from kilobases to megabases in size and can involve deletions (loss) or duplications (gain). They are a major source of both normal human genomic variation and serious neurogenetic disease.",

    {
      "question": "According to the ClinGen CNV dosage sensitivity framework, which finding most strongly supports pathogenicity of a deletion CNV?",

        "Overlap with a gene that has a ClinGen Haploinsufficiency score of 3 (sufficient evidence for HI) with a matching clinical phenotype",
        "Overlap with a common population CNV at >0.5% frequency in DGV",
        "Inheritance from an unaffected parent",
        "Location in a gene-sparse chromosomal region"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "A ClinGen Haploinsufficiency (HI) score of 3 indicates sufficient evidence that loss of one copy of this gene causes a clinically recognizable phenotype. A deletion encompassing such a gene, combined with a phenotype that matches the expected disorder, provides strong evidence of pathogenicity. Inheritance from an unaffected parent actually argues against pathogenicity (or for reduced penetrance)."

      "question": "A 2.5 Mb deletion at 22q11.2 is identified in a child with conotruncal heart defect, cleft palate, and developmental delay. This most likely represents:",

      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The clinical triad of conotruncal heart defect, palatal abnormality (velopharyngeal insufficiency or cleft palate), and developmental delay is characteristic of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome). This is the most common microdeletion syndrome, occurring in approximately 1/4,000 births, and is caused by a ~3 Mb deletion at 22q11.21."

      "question": "What mechanism generates recurrent CNVs at loci flanked by segmental duplications?",
      "options": [
        "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) during double-strand break repair",
        "Non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between flanking low-copy repeats during meiosis",
        "LINE-1 retrotransposon insertion causing focal amplification",
        "Replication fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS/MMBIR)"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Recurrent genomic disorders arise primarily through Non-Allelic Homologous Recombination (NAHR) — a meiotic recombination event between paralogous low-copy repeats (segmental duplications) flanking a genomic region. The high sequence homology between these repeats leads to misalignment, causing recurrent deletions or duplications of the intervening segment with highly consistent breakpoints."

      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 15q11–q13 region is subject to genomic imprinting. A maternal deletion of this region causes Angelman syndrome (characterized by intellectual disability, absent speech, seizures, and happy demeanor — due to loss of UBE3A, which is only expressed from the maternal allele in neurons). A paternal deletion of the same region causes Prader-Willi syndrome."

        "A 200 kb deletion in a region with no OMIM genes and 3% population frequency"

      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "A de novo CNV is ~10-fold more likely to be pathogenic than an inherited CNV. Combined with overlap of a gene with established haploinsufficiency (ClinGen HI score 3) and a clinically matching phenotype, this CNV would accumulate sufficient evidence across multiple domains to be classified Pathogenic under the ACMG/ClinGen framework."
