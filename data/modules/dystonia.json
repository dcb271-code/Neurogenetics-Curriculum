      "title": "Classification of Dystonia",
      "content": "Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements or postures. The 2013 consensus classification uses two axes: Axis I (clinical features) and Axis II (etiology). Clinical features include age of onset (infantile, childhood, adolescent, adult), body distribution (focal, segmental, multifocal, generalized, hemidystonia), temporal pattern (static/progressive, persistent/task-specific/action-induced/diurnal), and associated features (isolated vs. combined with other movement disorders).",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Isolated dystonia: dystonic movements are the only motor feature; formerly 'primary dystonia' — caused by pure dystonia genes (TOR1A, THAP1, GNAL, ANO3)",
        "Combined dystonia: dystonia plus another movement disorder (myoclonus, parkinsonism) — DYT-SGCE (myoclonus-dystonia), NBIA disorders, Wilson disease, DRD",
        "Complex dystonia: dystonia plus other neurological or systemic features — structural brain lesions, metabolic/genetic syndromes",
        "Diurnal fluctuation (worse late in day, improved by sleep) and dramatic levodopa response are hallmarks of dopa-responsive dystonia — always trial levodopa before concluding a childhood-onset dystonia is 'idiopathic'",
        "DYT numbering system: over 30 DYT loci designated; note that not all have confirmed causative genes, and some represent the same condition; current nomenclature: DYT-[gene] (e.g., DYT-TOR1A)"

      "title": "Dopa-Responsive Dystonia: The Must-Not-Miss Diagnosis",
      "content": "Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), most commonly caused by autosomal dominant variants in GCH1 (encoding GTP cyclohydrolase 1), is the single most important treatable genetic dystonia. It is caused by deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the essential cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases including tyrosine hydroxylase — the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. The response to low-dose levodopa is dramatic, sustained, and without motor fluctuations — distinguishing it from Parkinson disease. DRD is underdiagnosed because its initial presentation can mimic cerebral palsy, spastic diplegia, or idiopathic dystonia.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "GCH1 (14q22.1): autosomal dominant, ~5–10% penetrance reduction in males; female predominance 2:1 (hormonal modulation of dopamine synthesis); onset typically childhood with leg dystonia and gait abnormality",
        "Classic features: childhood-onset foot dystonia/gait abnormality + diurnal fluctuation (worse at end of day, dramatic improvement after sleep) + brisk or exaggerated deep tendon reflexes",
        "CSF neurotransmitters: low biopterin, low neopterin, low HVA (homovanillic acid — dopamine metabolite); can confirm diagnosis but response to L-dopa is more practical",
        "Levodopa trial: start at 1–2 mg/kg/day; dramatic, sustained response at very low doses (25–50 mg/day) is virtually diagnostic; no dyskinesia, no motor fluctuations distinguish from PD",
        "SPR gene (sepiapterin reductase): autosomal recessive DRD; often more severe with parkinsonism; elevated sepiapterin in CSF; requires both levodopa AND serotonin precursors (5-HTP) for full treatment"

      "content": "DYT-TOR1A (previously DYT1) is the most common form of early-onset primary generalized dystonia, caused by a dominantly inherited 3-bp in-frame deletion (ΔE302-303) in TOR1A, encoding torsinA — an AAA+ ATPase located in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. TOR1A has markedly reduced penetrance (~30–40%), meaning most carriers do not develop clinically significant dystonia. Onset is typically in a limb in childhood, with variable generalization.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "TOR1A ΔE302-303: in-frame GAG deletion accounts for nearly all pathogenic TOR1A variants; found in ~16% of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who develop early-onset dystonia — founder effect",
        "Penetrance: only ~30–40% of TOR1A ΔE deletion carriers develop dystonia; onset before age 26 in affected individuals; onset in a limb, may generalize but often remains segmental",
        "TorsinA function: involved in nuclear envelope integrity and LINC complex function; pathogenic mechanism involves impaired nuclear-cytoskeletal coupling in striatal neurons",
        "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi): most effective treatment for medically refractory TOR1A dystonia; 50–90% sustained improvement in young patients",
        "DYT-THAP1 (previously DYT6): AD with ~60% penetrance; onset often in cranial/cervical muscles or arm; adolescent onset common; less responsive to DBS than DYT-TOR1A; THAP1 encodes a transcription factor regulating TOR1A expression"

Recognizing the combined phenotype markedly narrows the genetic differential.",

The approach is guided by phenotype (isolated vs. combined, focal vs. generalized), family history, and associated findings. Genetic testing strategy has shifted toward panel-based NGS, but targeted testing is appropriate when the clinical picture strongly suggests a specific diagnosis.",

        "Brain MRI to exclude a structural basal ganglia lesion",

      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Diurnal fluctuation — dystonia that worsens through the day and markedly improves after sleep — is the clinical hallmark of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD, GCH1 deficiency). In any child with this pattern, a levodopa trial should be given before extensive neuroimaging or genetic testing. The response is dramatic, sustained, and at very low doses — virtually diagnostic of DRD. Delaying this simple trial is a common and consequential error."

      "question": "An Ashkenazi Jewish teenager develops left-hand dystonia at age 12 that gradually generalizes over two years. Levodopa trial is negative. Which gene and inheritance pattern should be tested first?",
      "options": [
        "GCH1 — autosomal dominant with maternal imprinting",
        "TOR1A (ΔE302-303 deletion) — autosomal dominant with reduced penetrance (~30–40%)",

        "WDR45 — X-linked dominant, de novo in females"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "TOR1A DYT1 (early-onset primary generalized dystonia) is significantly enriched in the Ashkenazi Jewish population due to a founder effect. The ΔE302-303 in-frame GAG deletion is the causative variant in nearly all cases. It is autosomal dominant with ~30–40% penetrance. Onset in a limb before age 26 with subsequent generalization is the classic phenotype. A levodopa-negative response appropriately excludes DRD before proceeding to this testing."

        "ADCY5 — paroxysmal dyskinesia, less responsive to DBS"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "KMT2B (lysine methyltransferase 2B) mutations cause an autosomal dominant childhood-onset generalized dystonia beginning in the lower limbs with prominent oromandibular involvement. Importantly, KMT2B dystonia is one of the genetic dystonias with the best reported outcomes after GPi deep brain stimulation — often dramatic and sustained improvement. Genetic diagnosis of KMT2B before DBS helps set expectations and justifies early surgical intervention."

        "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (PKAN) — treat with pantothenate",
        "Wilson disease (ATP7B) — treat with copper chelation (penicillamine or trientine) and zinc",

        "DRD (GCH1) — treat with levodopa/carbidopa"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Wilson disease (autosomal recessive ATP7B mutations) causes copper accumulation in liver, brain, and cornea. Kayser-Fleischer rings (copper deposits in Descemet membrane) detected by slit-lamp exam are pathognomonic. Treatment with copper chelators (D-penicillamine or trientine) and/or zinc (which blocks intestinal copper absorption) is highly effective — Wilson disease is fully treatable. Neurological Wilson disease may present with dystonia, tremor, psychiatric symptoms, and dysarthria."

      "question": "Myoclonus-dystonia (DYT-SGCE) shows a parent-of-origin effect because SGCE is:",
      "options": [
        "Located on the X chromosome, causing sex-linked expression",
        "Maternally imprinted — only the paternal allele is expressed in neurons",
        "Subject to mitochondrial inheritance — transmitted only through mothers",
        "Autosomal recessive with variable expressivity based on birth order"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "SGCE is a maternally imprinted gene — the maternal allele is silenced by methylation, so only the paternally inherited allele is expressed in neurons. This means disease occurs only when the pathogenic variant is inherited from the father. Children who inherit the same SGCE variant from their mother will be unaffected (even if they carry the variant), because the maternal SGCE allele is normally silenced. This parent-of-origin dependency explains why the condition can 'skip' generations in an apparent AD pedigree."
