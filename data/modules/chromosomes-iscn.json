Each chromosome has a characteristic size, centromere position, and banding pattern that allows unambiguous identification. G-banding (Giemsa staining after trypsin treatment) is the standard technique for cytogenetic analysis and produces the distinctive alternating light and dark band pattern used for karyotyping.",

        "A male with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)",
        "A female with trisomy 21",

      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "ISCN notation: 47 = total chromosome count, XY = male sex chromosomes, +21 = an extra copy of chromosome 21. This is trisomy 21, the chromosomal basis of Down syndrome. A '+' sign before a chromosome number denotes a gain (trisomy); a '−' sign denotes a loss (monosomy)."

        "Chromosome 7, long arm, region 1, band 1, sub-band 23",
        "Chromosome 7, long arm, locus 11, exon 23",
        "A deletion spanning 11.23 megabases on chromosome 7"

      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "ISCN band notation reads: chromosome number (7) + arm (q = long arm) + region (1) + band (1) + sub-band (23). Bands are numbered from the centromere outward. 7q11.23 is the critical region deleted in Williams-Beuren syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability, hypercalcemia, and hypersociability."

      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The slash (/) separates different cell lines in a mosaic individual. This karyotype shows two populations: 45,X (monosomy X — Turner syndrome) in 12 cells, and 46,XX (normal female) in 18 cells, out of 30 total metaphases analyzed. Mosaic Turner syndrome often presents with milder features than non-mosaic 45,X."

      "options": [
        "A duplication of approximately 5.8 Mb at 15q11.2q13.1",

      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "In array ISCN notation, ×1 indicates a single copy in a diploid individual, which means a deletion (normal diploid copy number is 2). The size of this deletion is approximately 28,585,846 − 22,805,313 = 5.78 Mb at 15q11.2q13.1. This region harbors the Angelman/Prader-Willi syndrome critical region."

        "inv(9;22)"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "In ISCN notation, 't' designates a translocation. A balanced reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 is written as t(9;22). The Philadelphia chromosome — t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) — is the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), creating the BCR::ABL1 fusion oncogene."
