      "content": "Ataxia is the inability to generate a normal voluntary movement trajectory that cannot be attributed to weakness or involuntary movement. It results from dysfunction of the cerebellum, proprioceptive pathways (dorsal columns, peripheral nerves), or vestibular system. The most critical initial step is determining the temporal pattern of ataxia — acute, episodic, subacute, or chronic/progressive — because this guides both the differential diagnosis and the urgency of evaluation.",

      "question": "A 16-year-old presents with progressive gait ataxia since age 12, absent lower limb reflexes, loss of vibration sense, and cardiomyopathy on echocardiogram. The most appropriate first-line test is:",
      "options": [
        "Comprehensive spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) repeat panel for SCA1–36",
        "Serum frataxin protein level, followed by FXN GAA repeat testing if low",
        "Brain MRI with gadolinium to rule out a posterior fossa mass",
        "Serum vitamin E and B12 levels"

      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "This presentation — onset in teenage years, gait ataxia, areflexia, large-fiber sensory neuropathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — is classic for Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). The first-line test is a serum frataxin protein level (ELISA); if low, FXN GAA repeat PCR is performed to confirm biallelic expanded repeats. SCA panels are appropriate for autosomal dominant pedigrees. Vitamin levels should be checked but are unlikely given the cardiomyopathy and typical FRDA phenotype."

    {
      "question": "A father with SCA3 has a son who is found to carry the expanded ATXN3 allele. The son develops symptoms 15 years earlier than his father did. This phenomenon is best explained by:",
      "options": [
        "Environmental modification of the SCA3 phenotype in subsequent generations",
        "Mosaicism for the CAG expansion in the son's cerebellum",
        "Genetic anticipation — the CAG repeat expanded further during paternal transmission",
        "The son has a de novo second pathogenic variant in ATXN3 that accelerates disease"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Genetic anticipation is the hallmark of CAG repeat spinocerebellar ataxias. During spermatogenesis, the expanded CAG repeat tends to further increase in length (especially with paternal transmission), resulting in a larger repeat, earlier onset, and more severe disease in the next generation. This is a well-documented biological phenomenon driven by repeat instability during DNA replication, not environmental or second-hit effects."

    {
      "question": "A 35-year-old with progressive ataxia and slow saccades is evaluated. Brain MRI shows cerebellar and brainstem atrophy. Family history: his mother had similar symptoms. NCS shows a sensorimotor neuropathy. Which SCA is most consistent with this picture?",
      "options": [
        "SCA6 — characterized by pure cerebellar ataxia without neuropathy",
        "SCA7 — characterized by progressive macular degeneration and cerebellar ataxia",
        "SCA2 — characterized by slow saccades, cerebellar atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy",
        "SCA1 — characterized by hyperreflexia and pyramidal signs without neuropathy"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "SCA2 (ATXN2) is strongly suggested by the combination of cerebellar ataxia, markedly slow saccadic eye movements (a cardinal and early feature), peripheral neuropathy on NCS, and autosomal dominant inheritance. Slow saccades in ataxia strongly favor SCA2 over other SCAs. SCA6 is a pure, late-onset cerebellar ataxia without neuropathy. SCA7 adds progressive macular degeneration. SCA1 typically has brisk reflexes and pyramidal features."

      "question": "Omaveloxolone was FDA-approved in 2023 for Friedreich ataxia. Its primary mechanism of action is:",
      "options": [
        "Delivery of exogenous frataxin protein to replace the deficient protein",
        "Activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway to reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress",
        "Inhibition of the mTOR pathway to slow neurodegeneration",
        "CAG repeat contraction via targeted CRISPR editing of the FXN locus"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Omaveloxolone (Skyclarys) is an Nrf2 activator — it activates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor, which upregulates antioxidant and cytoprotective genes, reducing the mitochondrial oxidative stress caused by frataxin deficiency. It is not a frataxin replacement, gene therapy, or CRISPR-based approach. The MOXIe Phase 3 trial demonstrated significant improvement in neurological function scores in patients ≥16 years with FRDA."

      "question": "When ordering genetic testing for a patient with chronic progressive ataxia, why is standard exome sequencing insufficient to detect Friedreich ataxia?",
      "options": [
        "The FXN gene is located in a region of low sequencing coverage",
        "Standard NGS does not reliably detect large trinucleotide repeat expansions, which require dedicated repeat-primed PCR or long-read sequencing",
        "Exome sequencing does not include intronic regions, so intron 1 GAA repeats are not captured",
        "The GAA repeat is located in a pseudogene that confounds alignment"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Standard next-generation sequencing (NGS), including exome and gene panel sequencing, cannot reliably detect large trinucleotide or other repeat expansions. Short-read NGS fragments (typically 150 bp) cannot span large repeats, and the repetitive sequence causes alignment artifacts. Friedreich ataxia is caused by GAA repeat expansions in intron 1 of FXN — typically hundreds to thousands of repeats. Detection requires dedicated repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) or long-read technologies (PacBio, Oxford Nanopore). This is a critical limitation clinicians must know when interpreting a 'normal' exome in a patient with ataxia."
