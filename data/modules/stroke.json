      "content": "Approximately 5–10% of all strokes and up to 25–30% of strokes in patients under 45 years have a definable genetic cause. Genetic stroke syndromes should be suspected when stroke occurs in young patients, is recurrent, affects multiple family members, is associated with specific non-stroke neurological features, or has characteristic MRI findings. A systematic approach to genetic diagnosis has direct therapeutic implications and informs family member screening.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Red flags for genetic stroke: age <45 years without traditional cardiovascular risk factors, family history of early stroke, recurrent strokes in multiple vascular territories, stroke with concurrent white matter disease, stroke with systemic features (rash, renal disease, ophthalmological findings), stroke with hearing loss or migraine",
        "Monogenic vs. polygenic contribution: most common stroke is multifactorial; rare monogenic causes include CADASIL, MELAS, CARASIL, COL4A1/2 angiopathy, Fabry disease, sickle cell disease, coagulopathies, FMD",
        "Children with stroke: cardiac embolism, sickle cell disease, arterial dissection, CNS vasculitis, and metabolic disorders (homocystinuria, organic acidemias) are important causes; prothrombotic workup and echo essential",
        "MRI red flags: cortical/parieto-occipital signal abnormality crossing vascular territories (MELAS stroke-like episodes), periventricular white matter disease in young adult (CADASIL), cortical restricted diffusion in non-vascular distribution (MELAS in acute phase), temporal lobe WMH (CADASIL), cerebellar strokes in young adults (COL4A1)",

It is a primary arteriopathy — not a coagulopathy — affecting cerebral small vessels.",

        "NOTCH3: all pathogenic CADASIL variants are cysteine-altering variants in the EGF-r domain (exons 2–24); they cause an odd number of cysteines in the domain, leading to aberrant disulfide bonding and GOM (granular osmiophilic material) deposits in vessel walls",
        "Clinical tetrad: migraine with aura (often first symptom, 3rd–4th decade), recurrent subcortical lacunar strokes (4th–5th decade), psychiatric disturbance (depression, apathy, personality change), progressive cognitive decline → vascular dementia (5th–6th decade)",
        "MRI signature: extensive periventricular and subcortical white matter hyperintensities; early involvement of anterior temporal lobes and external capsule is characteristic and relatively specific; multiple old lacunar infarcts in basal ganglia, thalamus, pons",
        "Diagnosis: NOTCH3 sequencing (targeted EGF-r domain exons or whole gene); skin biopsy electron microscopy showing GOM deposits (supportive but less sensitive than sequencing); GOM on biopsy is not specific to EGF-r cysteine variants",
        "No disease-modifying therapy; antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) for secondary stroke prevention; statins, antihypertensives as for other small vessel disease; anticoagulation is not beneficial; migraine management — avoid triptans in active infarct history"

Understanding this distinction has critical management implications.",

      "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents with a third episode of subcortical lacunar stroke. She has a history of migraine with aura since age 28 and her father had dementia and strokes in his 50s. MRI shows extensive periventricular white matter changes and old lacunar infarcts in the external capsule and anterior temporal lobes. The most likely diagnosis is:",
      "options": [
        "MELAS — confirmed by elevated serum lactate during the episode",
        "CADASIL — autosomal dominant NOTCH3 arteriopathy with characteristic anterior temporal and external capsule involvement",
        "Antiphospholipid syndrome — requires anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta2GP1 antibody testing",
        "CARASIL — autosomal recessive, caused by HTRA1 mutations"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is suggested by: autosomal dominant family history, recurrent lacunar strokes, migraine with aura as an early symptom, and the characteristic MRI pattern of extensive WMH with prominent anterior temporal lobe and external capsule involvement. NOTCH3 EGF-r domain sequencing is the diagnostic test of choice."

      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The presentation — adolescent, DWI signal crossing vascular boundaries in the posterior cortex, elevated lactate — is characteristic of a MELAS stroke-like episode (SLE). SLEs are caused by mitochondrial energy failure in neurons, NOT vascular occlusion; thrombolytics are contraindicated and could cause hemorrhage. IV L-arginine (a nitric oxide precursor) is the standard acute treatment for MELAS SLE — it reduces the vascular component of the episode. Anticonvulsants and metabolic support are also given."

      "explanation": "Fabry disease (X-linked GLA deficiency) classically presents in males with acroparesthesias (burning pain in hands/feet), progressive renal disease, and early stroke in the 3rd-4th decade. The maternal family history (X-linked inheritance through maternal uncle) is consistent. Enzyme replacement therapy (agalsidase) is available, making genetic diagnosis directly therapeutic. Alpha-galactosidase A enzyme activity in leukocytes is the first-line test in males; GLA sequencing confirms the variant."

        "Recommend folate supplementation prophylactically regardless of homocysteine level"
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "MTHFR C677T is one of the most over-interpreted genetic variants in clinical medicine. The MTHFR variant itself is NOT an independent stroke risk factor. Its clinical relevance is confined to situations where it causes elevated plasma homocysteine. If plasma homocysteine is normal, MTHFR C677T requires no specific intervention. If homocysteine is elevated, folate/B12/B6 supplementation is appropriate to normalize levels. MTHFR testing is not recommended in stroke workup guidelines — measuring homocysteine directly is the correct approach."

        "Regular chronic red blood cell transfusion therapy to maintain HbS below 30%",
        "Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The STOP trial demonstrated that in children with sickle cell disease and elevated TCD velocities (≥200 cm/s), regular chronic transfusion therapy reducing HbS to <30% reduces first stroke risk by approximately 90% compared to observation. This is the standard of care for high-risk SCD children identified by TCD screening. Hydroxyurea is used for stroke prevention in lower-risk patients or when transfusion is not feasible. Antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation are not first-line for primary stroke prevention in SCD."
